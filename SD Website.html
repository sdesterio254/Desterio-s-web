        <p>It was officially started in the year<br> 2001 under Silvia and Moses Ndun'gu.This was as a result
            of after they saw many children in the<br> streets and many who were suffering due to carelessness
            of their parents,they were filled with pity<br> towards those children and so decided to set a place
            where they could settle those children.They influenced<br> the children to nature their tallents and 
            use their tallents to earn a living.
        </p>
        <p>Acording to own thoughts you may think that a<br> children home is the poorest place to be,
            but this is not the case in Children's Garden.<br>This is a home which has natured lives
            of many orphaned and less fortunate children who have<br> grown and are able to provide for 
            themselves under the help from other sponsors.This still<br> continues upto date.
        Currently,the institution holds more than a hundred and fifty<br> valnerable children and each and
        every one of them their needs are being attended to effectively.</p>
